Hi, Iâ€™m Phil, an iOS developer based in London, UK.

I love mobile and I love software development. Iâ€™m awed by the power of a computer in the palm of your hand. I want to use that power to make a positive impact on peopleâ€™s lives.

I care about application architecture, SOLID design principles and thorough unit testing. Iâ€™m happy to connect with anyone passionate about mobile computing or software development. Email me at phillipbaker@hey.com.
