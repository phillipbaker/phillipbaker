Hi, Iâ€™m Phil.

Iâ€™m a self-taught iOS developer based in London, UK. Iâ€™m currently working on portfolio projects that I hope will get me one step closer to my first profesisonal iOS development role.

You can see my code here on Github. You can read more about my priorities, thought process and decision making on my [personal website](http://phillipbaker.me/).
